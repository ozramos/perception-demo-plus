# Wayve Perception Demo +

This quick demo expands on [Wayve's new SegNet model](https://wayve.ai/blog/2018/10/8/vision-for-driving-with-deep-learning) by inferring off of Google Street Views. You can extend this idea by automating the Street View using only the learned data, collecting it all for use later on in a cloud service while you sleep!

The code controlling the street view is in [vroom-vroom.js](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/perception-demo-plus?path=vroom-vroom.js:1:0), along with some simple helpers for extracting the data.
